                                    The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (French pronunciation: ​[siʁkɥi də spa
                                    fʁɑ̃kɔʁʃɑ̃]), frequently referred to as Spa, is a 7.004 km (4.352 mi) motor-racing
                                    circuit located in Stavelot, Belgium. It is the current venue of the Formula One
                                    Belgian Grand Prix, hosting its first Grand Prix in 1925, and has held a Grand Prix
                                    every year since 1985 (except 2003 and 2006).

                                    Spa also hosts several other international events including the 24 Hours of Spa, the
                                    World Endurance Championship 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, and the TCR Spa 500. It
                                    is also home to the Uniroyal Fun Cup 25 Hours of Spa, one of the longest motor races
                                    in the world.

                                    The circuit has undergone several redesigns through its history, most extensively in
                                    1979 when the track was modified and shortened from a 14.100 km (8.761 mi) circuit
                                    using public roads to a 6.968 km (4.330 mi) permanent circuit due to safety concerns
                                    with the old circuit.
